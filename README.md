A project overview is a detailed description of a project's goals and objectives, the steps to achieve these goals, and the expected outcomes. In addition, a project overview enables you to outline the project schedule, budget, necessary resources, and status.

### Goals And Objective

(aim of the project)
---- all this will be in bullet point
the aim of this project is to clean a dataset

### Data Source/ and Data Dictionary:

Sales Data: the primary dataset for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.
Dataset Description:

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- Power BI  - Creating reports

## Analysis

### Data Cleaning
in the initial data preparation phase we performed the foloeing tasks:
1. data loading and inspection
2. handling missing values
3. data cleaning and formula
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which product are top seller?
- What are the peak sales periods?
  
### Data Analysis
```sql
select * from Das
where r = 2
```
### Explanotory Data Analysis

## Result/Key Findings/Insight
the analysis results are summarized as folows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season
2. product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue
3. customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

## Reccomendation:
based on the anlysis, we recommend the following actions:
- invest in marketing and promotion during peak sales seasons 
to maximize revenue.
