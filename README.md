# Call Centre Data Cleaning With Python

We sold a video editing course to our customers. After they bought it, we wanted to inform them about another product, Product B. To do this, we retargeted them with an in-stream ad, where we explained how Product B could really help them with their projects and encouraged them to fill out a form to show their interest. After collecting their responses, we noticed that some of the information wasnâ€™t clear or correct. We need to fix that information, so our call center team can reach out to these customers and try to help them buy Product B.

### Goals And Objective
- Check for missing values and populate if necessary.
- Remove Duplicates: Identify and eliminate duplicate records to ensure each entry is unique.
- Standardize Formats.

### Data Source

The primary dataset for this project, titled "Customer Call List.xlsx," contains detailed information about each customer, including the following fields: CustomerID, First_Name, Last_Name, Phone_Number, Paying Customer, Do_Not_Contact, Street_Name, City_Name, and State.


### Tools

## Analysis

### Data Cleaning
in the initial data preparation phase we performed the following tasks:
1. data loading and inspection
2. handling missing values

### Result/Key Findings/Insight
the analysis results are summarized as folows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season
2. product category A is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue
3. customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

## Reccomendation:
based on the anlysis, we recommend the following actions:
- invest in marketing and promotion during peak sales seasons 
to maximize revenue.
